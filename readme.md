# Password Strength Checker

A Python-based Password Strength Checker that evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria. This tool helps users create stronger, more secure passwords by analyzing length, character diversity, and patterns commonly found in weak passwords. Feedback is provided to guide users on improving weak passwords.

## Features

- **Length Check**: Evaluates if the password is long enough for optimal security.
- **Character Diversity Check**: Checks for the inclusion of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters.
- **Common Pattern Detection**: Detects common patterns (e.g., "password", "1234") and discourages their usage.
- **Feedback**: Provides suggestions on how to strengthen a weak password.
  
## Strength Scale

The tool evaluates password strength on a scale:
- **Very Weak**
- **Weak**
- **Moderate**
- **Strong**
- **Very Strong**

## How It Works

The password strength is determined based on:
1. **Length**: A minimum of 8 characters is recommended for stronger security.
2. **Character Diversity**: Mix of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters.
3. **Avoiding Common Patterns**: The tool discourages using common patterns or simple sequences.
